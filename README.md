# UFO
## Overview
* In this project, I created a table for Dana to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table has the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and was created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.
* Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
## Resources
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* VS Code
## Results
* The new webpage has the ability to navigate through the dataset of recorded UFO sightings by entering in the date, city, state, country, and shape. These filters can also operate independently, therefore, you can enter search criteria in as many, or as few of the filters as you'd like.

  * Date
    * If someone wanted to find every sighting that was recorded on a specific date, they can enter the desired date into the "Date" filter, and the program will return every sighting that matches the entered criteria.

  * Multiple

## Summary
* The biggest drawback of this webpage is that we are limited to the size of our dataset. I'm from Austin, TX and I think it would be very interesting to see what sightings have been recorded here, but since there isn't any information on Austin in the dataset, nothing will come up when trying to filter for it.
* A recomendation I have to imrove the webpage is to add a filter for keywords in the comments. There are a lot of similar descriptions, such as 3 red lights, so it would be cool to see if there were multiple sightings of that phenomenon in a particular time or place . Another recomendation is to add a community page or forum, much like reddit. It would be cool to have a place where users can share their experinces and have discussions amongst eachother. I think that would make the webpage become a one-stop shop for all UFO enthusiast.
